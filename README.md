# COVESA solutions and recommendations within Vehicle Data Solutions

## Introduction

The COVESA vision is to find and agree on a common approach for defining and exchanging vehicle data,
and a common approach for defining and invoking vehicle services.
This could, but does not necessarily need to, include agreeing on common IDLs/APIs for exchanging data and invoking services.

## Architecture Overview

The [Architecture Overview](architecture_overview.md) gives an introduction and definition of the terms used by COVESA
to describe the Vehicle Data Architecture.

## Intended Scope of COVESA

The following items are within the scope of COVESA

* Defining high level architecture
* Defining the VSS metadata format
* Defining the catalog of standardized signals in VSS
* Defining abstract components and suggested feature sets of those components
* Collecting and defining best practices on how to support vehicle data
* Implementing tools to convert VSS-signals and VSS-like signals to other representations
* Collaboration with organizations working on topics listed as "out of scope" below.

Out of scope for COVESA

* Implementing Vehicle Signal Servers
* Defining VSS APIs
* Implementing frameworks for developing and deploying Vehicle Services
